# Overview

I took on this project to learn more about data analysis and what tools I have as a software developer to be able to gleam more information from data. It was an experience that helps me understand that there are very practical uses for programming in statistical work.

I was studying information that we have regarding the sinking of the titanc. The data was focused on those were on the ship, and mentioned whether or not they survived, their gender, if they were sailing first class, etc.

I was interested in how the background factors that made up everyone's lives affected their mortality rate on the titanic. Trying to see what were the biggest factors that seperated those who survived versus those who passed away during that tragedy.

# Data Analysis Results

I pondered how the wealth of those on board affected their chance of survival. Research showed that those who were upper class had a noticeable edge in staying alive from the accident.
I questioned if age was a significant factor, and saw that age primarily had almost no effect on the mortality rate of those involved in the accident.
My final question was whether their gender played a role, and it was by and far the leading difference in who lived and died. The Women were far more likely to be saved on the titanic then all of the men who passed away in the cold waters.

# Development Environment

I utilized Visual Studio Code for my IDE and used it to look at and analyze the CSV file of data

I was able to program this in python will the help of the numpy and pandas libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I can analyze more aspects that affected those on tthe titanic
* I can work on analyzing other information on other topics as well
* I can draw comparisons between whether these factors are universal or specific to the events of the titanic.
